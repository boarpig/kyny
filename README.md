Kyny is a simple wordgame with highscore lists and such because I wanted to 
learn html5+javascript+bottle.py. Serverside is written using bottle.py and 
sqlite and frontend is written using html5 + javascript.

You'll need python3 and tornado to run the server. You can also simply remove 
'server="tornado"' from the last line in kyny.py to use wsgiref server 
provided by python.
